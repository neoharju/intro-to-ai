# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: personal copy

This is my personal copy of the course material for **Introduction to AI**, a course at the Department of
Computer Science, University of Helsinki. I am only modifying it for my own use. It is not the official
course.

## Credits

The course material is the work of the course staff and the contributors of the original repository.
Thank you for making it openly available.

## What I changed

Compared with the original `gh-pages` branch (commit `b9dedeb`):

- **Front-end dependencies:** jQuery, Bootstrap, highlight.js and Font Awesome are upgraded and, like the
  Inter font, served from this repository instead of third-party CDNs. The shared JavaScript and CSS are
  built from `src/`.
- **Docker preview:** a `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` to preview the site locally.
- **Corrections in weeks 1–7:** factual errors and broken code examples are corrected.
- **Removed:** the original course's Google Analytics tracking, cookie banner and disabled login form,
  unused images, and the icon and font files the pages never load.
- **Design:** a new look (Inter font, a sticky top bar, a header for each week, cards for hints and
  exercises, a table of contents that highlights the current section) and interactive figures in every
  week, from search algorithms and alpha-beta pruning to attention and Q-learning. The figures run the
  algorithms described in the text, in the browser; their code is in `src/javascripts/viz/`.

## Preview locally

GitHub Pages publishes this branch as it is. The pages are plain HTML (`index.html`, `week1/` to `week7/`).
To preview them:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The site is served at <http://localhost:4567>.

## Rebuild the assets

The shared JavaScript, CSS and fonts in `javascripts/`, `stylesheets/` and `fonts/vendor/` are built from
`src/` and committed, because GitHub Pages does not run a build. After changing `src/` or the dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

Then commit the changes in `javascripts/`, `stylesheets/` and `fonts/vendor/`.
